#Sensitivity of resampling to estimated sequestration rates - allows estimation of duration...

# title         : sensitiv_SOC.R
# purpose       : assess sensitivity of repeat sampling
# reference     :
# producer      : Prepared by I. Wheeler
# last update   : In Sydney, AU, July 2012.
# inputs        : ..........
# outputs       : summary table ................
# remarks 1     : ........ Given assumptions: 1: independant sample selection between rounds; 2: approximately the same sampling variance as the first round; 3: roughly the same total cost of sampling (i.e. the same number of n)
